Many thanks to TechGuard for his original work on this great Craftbukkit plugin.

Changelog:
Version z2.1:

* Xarqn forked iGrow plugin
* "MinecraftTime" message is now an optional debug message and false by default
* All iGrow messages are now prefixed by [iGrow:<version #>], additional debug messages added - these WILL spam your server log
* Multiworld!   
* Recipes can now have a comment on the same line as the recipe (eg. "4,48,9,30:100,false,world  # cobble to moss adj. water")

Bugs
* timer keeps on queuing changes. If the server can't keep up with the current changes this will eventually overload and crash the server.

Quirks
* flowers will grow underground too if there is air below the grass block and another grass block below that (allow to select direction/faces to change?)
* can't use 1:1 chance
* be wary of using a large number of droppables (eg. mass growth of reeds in areas they won't stay) as this can lag the clients (doesn't seem to lag the server so much)

Todo:

* key/value recipe lines (eg. old:AIR,new:GLOWSTONE,needs:LEAVES,chance:30/100,world:myworld,near:false)
   - this allows lines to be read in any order, easily verify recipes, default values for world & near so doesn't matter if these are left out
* lightlevel requirements
* biome requirements
* face specification
Build a hash map:
blockCountMap("LEAVES", "3")
faceMap("+X", block), faceMap("X", block), etc


* add lists for world, ie. world:[myworld1,myworld2]
* add NOT for world, ie. world:NOT[thisworld]
* edge/corner specification
* advanced requirements (eg. AND[3f[LEAVES|LOGS],NOT[1f[WATER]]])
* "near" requirements (eg. cobble to mossy at random (low chance) but not NEAR 3 blocks of lava)
